Page 0 of the packet has a series of function that should be put into a
header file, and used instead of the standard functions. They're meant to relieve
you from a bunch of if statements.

Two methods of processing arrays:

Sentinels are values that aren't actual data, that signal the end of an array.

Counts are used when you know exactly how many elements the array has.



Pointer Arethematic works thusly: 

*a++ 	//a is incremented by unit size. If a is the address of an int, it will 
		//increment the size of an int. Portable across systems
		
No invariants in loops. 


Pointers can use indices (ex ptr[1], ptr[-1]), which returns the address 
that's off by the index. You can alternatively dereference something by doing
ptr[0].

C is a pass by VALUE language. Anything you want to change inside a function
must be passed by ADDRESS.

Promotion is NEVER dangerous, demotion most always is.
