Note to self: Pay attention to the requirements, and remember to close files!

in functions, you can get away without using a 'mover' pointer, if you don't
need a second pointer in a for loop for some reason, you can use use the array
pointer, and move that.


Don't put functions into declaration area, and put whitespace between
declaration areas and executable.

Indentation is important (already doing this).
