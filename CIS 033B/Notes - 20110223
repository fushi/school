$pid = fork();

What happens? It creates a child process. Everything is given to both the parent and the child, and a PID is returned. Child receives 0 as PID, and the parent receives the childs actual PID.

$$ is the current PID

PID 0 is the parent and all children
PID -1 is the same as 0, plus the parent of the parent

If a signal is sent


Passive Sockets - Used by the parent to listen for new client connection requests
Active Sockets - Used by children to talk to the client
