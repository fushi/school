You have a file with lines which look like this:

Wolf Wpider:acgttagcgctacgatttccgac

On each line there is an animal name followed by a colon then a
sequence of letters which stand for DNA nucleotides. Write a
script which will take the following command line arguments: an
input filename, an output filename, a positive integer, and a
letter which must be a 't', 'c', 'a', or 'g'. Your script will
output all lines from the input file which contain the letter
in the nucleotide string at least as many times as indicated
by the integer command line argument. Your answer MUST NOT
CONTAIN A LOOP.
